# Loan Approval System

## Overview
The Loan Approval System is designed to streamline the process of evaluating loan applications. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system predicts the likelihood of loan approval based on applicant details and financial information. This helps financial institutions make informed decisions quickly and efficiently.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales numerical features.
- **Model Training:** Machine learning models for binary classification of loan approvals.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Provides loan approval predictions for new applicants.
- **Reports and Metrics:** Detailed performance metrics and visualizations for insights.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Pip (Python Package Installer)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-approval-system.git
   cd loan-approval-system
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
The project uses datasets with labeled loan application data. Example datasets include:
- [Kaggle Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)

Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
1. Preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Test the model:
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the web interface.
